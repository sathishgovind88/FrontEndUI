# FrontEndUI
UI Test Front end
I have implemented Automation Cucumber BDD,JUnit framework and Maven build management tool for UI front end test and used Java languages with Selenium automation tool.

Part 2(Front End test challenge test)
Cucumber framework is scenario based tool so we can write the test steps in Feature file. The advantages of this framework its easy to use,
maintanance and reusable.

Three important files
Feature (Creating the scenarios)
Step definitions(Java automation scripts)
Test Runner(to drive the execution)

Please find the below UI validations using automation scripts.
  Navigate to Free Now Url
	Validate Free Now Home page logo and title
	Validate Free Now Page headers 
	Validate total Taxi Count with total Table Count
	Validate Free Now clicking upon taxi details,status and conditions
	Validate Footer options Navigate to Next,Last,Previous and First page
  
I have executed the automation scripts in locally its executed successfully and deployed the scripts into Circleci server 
but due to server folder configuration error was thrown "Driver is not executable" though browser driver exe is placed in the project folder
